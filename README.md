graph
=====
#What is this?
This is little foray into graph analytics using python. I am working on this as a summer intern
#How to use it?
Just clone the repository and you're good to go.
#Why it sucks?
Because 
1. Poorly Documented
2. Poorly Structured
3. Some Algorithms are slow.
#How it can be used?
This can be a learning tool for anyone who is new into Graph Analytics. Since the code is really bare you can probably understand the bare workings of it.
#HELP ME MAKE THIS BETTER
##Links
Here are a few links for those interested in graphs
1. [Networkv](https://networkx.github.io/) This is written in Python it is slow for very large graphs. On the Plus side it's well documented and has a huge support community and learning material.
2. [Graph Tool](http://graph-tool.skewed.de/) This is really fast. But it's new and lacking in documentation
